    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Roast beef doesn't refer to just one cut of beef — eye of round, bottom round roast, top round roast, top sirloin roast,
        and bone-in rib roast are all commonly used cuts. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Affordable eye of round roast is the best pick for this recipe — its
        rich flavors develop beautifully during slow cooking.
    </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste.</li>
        <li>T½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste.</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying
            out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
        <li>CPlace in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can
            redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
