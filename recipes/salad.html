    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        There's a lot to love about this top-rated cucumber tomato salad recipe. It's inexpensive to make using everyday
        ingredients, it's a crisp and refreshing side dish that goes with just about anything, and it has make-ahead
        convenience built right in.
    </p>
    <p>
        This salad provides a snappy contrast to creamy potato, macaroni, or pasta salads
        and can hold its own at any potluck. Let's dive into this dish and see why Allrecipes home cooks awarded it with
        hundreds of 5-stars reviews.

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the ingredients for the dressing</li>
        <li>Peel and slice the cucumbers</li>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes into wedges</li>
        <li>Slice the onion into rings</li>
        <li>Place everything together in a bowl</li>
        <li>After that, it goes into the refrigerator to marinate for at least two hours so the dressing can work its
            magic to enhance and balance all the flavors. That marination step means you can make this salad well ahead
            of time and stash it in the fridge until you're ready to dish it up.</li>
